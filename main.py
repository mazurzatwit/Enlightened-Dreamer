## Enlightened Dreamer will help our users delve deeper into their dreams and 
## sleep patterns. By tracking sleep patterns, users are able to analyze what 
## their dreams mean and how they might relate to their current state of mind. 
## The project consists of a web application supported by a backend that controls
## all user interaction. This user interaction includes recording dreams, a web 
## connection, and collects data on the userâ€™s sleep patterns to be stored in a 
## secondary storage. The data will be displayed by a GUI via the use of the backend.
